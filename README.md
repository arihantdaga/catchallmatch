# CatchAllMatch

The thing started when my friends [Mr. Saikat](https://github.com/saikatharryc) and [Chaithanya](https://github.com/chaymankala) tagged me in a facebook post having a video of something they called Tinder Finger, which swipes for you when you can sit back and play cards with your friends. And Mr. saikat suggested this as a very useful device for me. 

Although There was a problem with that, it would blindly right swipe all of them, But Mr. saikat i am not that Desperate. Plus i really wont carry it to the kitty parties and play cards while it keep swiping for me.. =D.

So i decided to hack something up for myself. The very first thing which excited me about learning to code was the idea of making apps for myself. "How great it would be, if i can make an application for whatever i need, right ? "

I am using this now, I haven't tested how many matches its going to bring me yet, but i am sure it is doing its job at best, Day and night, 24 Hours... I have my fingers crossed... (Atleast few would have swiped me right too.. =D ). 

But i think it can help many desperate souls like me. So i decided to keep it public.
